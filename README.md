Member Profile System used by AIESEC in Delhi University 2013 to manage its members and task allocations.

This system was put on hold for implementation of better security machenism. The few things on agenda are
  - A better password storing machanism. PBKKDF2 with SHA-1 or 256 will be preffered.
  - Query filtering to make it SQL Injection proof.
  - Code need to be cleaned to check for more issues. 

The other system that is required to be worked upon is to archive yearly records which are not handled yet.
